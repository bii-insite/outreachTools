# Modifying 'Spin The Wheel'

## Basic Structure
spinTheWheel.md is a markdown file - it accepts HTML as well as shortcuts that make HTML coding easier. There can be three overarching sections in html/md generally, and there are in three sections in this file particularly: 

1. the css section, where you can add in styling information, marked by the &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; tags,
2. the HTML section, where the elements of the page are actually specified (in spinTheWheel, this section is all contained within &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; tags), and
3. the JavaScript section, where you can program the page to interact dynamically with users, marked by &lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt; tags.
